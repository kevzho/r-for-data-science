Combining multiple elements into a vector with `c()`:
```{r}
fibonacci <- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) #assignment of vector to "fibonacci" variable
```
Performing basic arithmetic with vectors:
```{r}
fibonacci * 2
fibonacci - 3
```

`seq(from = , to = )` creates a sequence from the parameter you put in `from = ` to the parameter you put in `to = `. However, you can omit the names of the arguments and just do `seq(x, y)` where x and y are the bounds.
