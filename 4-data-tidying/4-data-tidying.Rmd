### Lengthening Data

We can use `pivot_longer()` to get rid of 

```{r}
billboard_longer <- billboard |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), #all columns starting with "wk" are gathered in one column
    names_to = "week", #all of them become new column called week
    values_to = "rank", #The values go into the new column called "rank
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    week = parse_number(week) #parses "wk1", "wk2" into numeric week numbers
  )

billboard_longer
```

```{r}
billboard_longer |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = rank, group = track)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.25) + 
  scale_y_reverse()
```
