This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# libs to import
library(tidyverse)

# Performing experiments with penguins dataset

# Would usually use glimpse(), but in RStudio use View()
# View(penguins)
head(penguins) #first few lines

# Verify device is still active
dev.cur()

# Goal: find the correlation between body mass (g) and flipper length.

# Utilizing ggplot() for blank graph (canvas)
# mapping argument -> always defined in aes() function
# aes() function specify which variables to map to x & y axes

# We can also color code different traits in a table -> scaling

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_len, y = body_mass)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) + # adds points to plot
  #creates scatterplot, mapping different shape and color to each species.
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") #linear regression



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
